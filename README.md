# README

TMCraft is a Cobblemon side mod that add TMs with recipes. Mods like EMI is highly recommended for viewing recipes. This mod is not a unique work of mine and heavily motivated by SimpleTMs made by Dragomordor. Most of the heavy lifting is done by Dragomordor. Here are few things different from SimpleTMs.

- Removed feature wild Pokémon dropping TMs when fainted
- Replaced TM textures with those based on Cobblemon Assets

By the term TM, the mod follows Gen IX. Which means TMs are consumed after being used. Pokémon will not be able to learn egg moves and tutor moves with TMs.

## Recipes

As of 1.4.2, all TM recipes for all generation have been added.

For server admins who prefer TMCraft without recipes, try using `x.x.x+x.x.x-norecipes` version of the mod.

- [TMCraft Missing Recipes](https://github.com/KiwiFlavoredApollo/tmcraft-missing-recipes)

TMCraft Missing Recipes is a data pack that adds recipes which are not meant to be included in the mod. Server admins can use this as a template.

If your favorite TMs do not have recipes and if you have an idea, feel free to contact me and give suggestions.

## TMs & Blank Discs

- Copper Blank Disc [0, 30)
- Iron Blank Disc [30, 60)
- Gold Blank Disc [60, 90)
- Diamond Blank Disc [90, 120)
- Netherite Blank Disc 120+
- Emerald Blank Disc (for status moves)

Move Upgrade Smithing Template is used when upgrading tiers. Blank Discs are used as ingredients for crafting TMs.

Starting from 1.3.0, Move Upgrade Smithing Template replaces Netherite Upgrade Smithing Template.

## Egg Move Items

Egg Move Items teach moves that are supposed to be learned via breeding.

## Tutor Move Items

Tutor Move Items teach moves that are learned by Move Tutors.

## Star Move Items

Star Move Items teach moves even if the Pokémon are not supposed to learn them. These are basically cheating so use them at your own risk. With great power comes great responsibility.

## Move Recorders

When used, Move Recorder converts to corresponding TM/Egg/Tutor/Star move item.
