# README

TMCraft is a Cobblemon side mod that add TMs with recipes. Mods like EMI is highly recommended for viewing recipes. This mod is not a unique work of mine and heavily motivated by SimpleTMs made by Dragomordor. Most of the heavy lifting is done by Dragomordor. Here are few things different from SimpleTMs.

- Removed feature wild Pokemon dropping TMs when fainted
- Replaced TM textures with those based on Cobblemon Assets

By the term TM, the mod follows Gen IX. Which means TMs are consumed after being used. Pokemon will not be able to learn egg moves and move tutor moves with TMs.

## Tiered Blank Discs

### Attack Moves

There are five tiered blank discs. Each Blank Discs can be used for crafting TMs with power range of the following:

- Copper Blank Disc [0, 30)
- Iron Blank Disc [30, 60)
- Gold Blank Disc [60, 90)
- Diamond Blank Disc [90, 120)
- Netherite Blank Disc 120+

Netherite Upgrade Smithing Template is used when upgrading tiers.

### Status Moves

Emerald Blank Discs can be crafted from Gold Blank Disc with Netherite Upgrade Smithing Template and Emerald Block.

## Egg Moves & Move Tutors

Items corresponding to egg moves and move tutors are added starting from the following versions.    

- 1.2.1 (for Cobblemon 1.6)
- 1.1.2 (for Cobblemon 1.5.2)

The items are basically the same as the TM items except that they allow teaching moves only when the Pokémon can learn them via egg moves or move tutors.

## Recipe Ideas

Since there are 900+ moves, it is impossible to add recipes for every single move (I do not intend to do so). If your favorite TMs do not have recipes and if you have an idea, feel free to contact me and give suggestions.

## TODOs
- [ ] TM/TR 아이템을 결정하는 방식은 인첸트와 비슷함
- [ ] 인첸트 테이블에 디스크를 올리고 타입젬을 소모해서 원하는 기술의 타입을 결정
- [ ] 기술은 랜덤으로 주어진 선택지에서 골라야 함
